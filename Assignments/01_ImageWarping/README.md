# Image Warping using Moving Least Squares

This repository is HongLiang Liu's  implementation of the image warping techniques described in the paper [Image Deformation Using Moving Least Squares](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/mls.pdf). The project demonstrates both basic image transformations and point-guided deformations using the Moving Least Squares (MLS) algorithm.

## Environment
OS: Windows
Python: 3.11

### Environment Installation
use conda to install the virtual environment
### 1.Create virtual environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n DIP python=3.11
conda activate DIP
```

### 2.Install requirements
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all necessary Python packages to run the code.

## Running
### Basic Transformation

To perform basic image transformations (e.g., affine, similarity, and rigid transformations), run the following command:

```
python run_global_transform.py
```
This script will apply various global transformations to an input image and display the results.

### Point-Guided Deformation
To perform point-guided deformation using the Moving Least Squares algorithm, run the following command:

```
python run_point_transform.py
```
This script allows you to interactively select points on an image and deform the image based on the movement of these points.

## Results
### Basic Transformation
